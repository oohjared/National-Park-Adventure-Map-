# National Park Adventure Planner

## Description

Given no source code, built an application that utilized two server APIs to create a National Park Adventure Planner.  Using HTML for the base structure, CSS, Bootstrap, Google Fonts and Font Awesome for the styling and jQuery and JavaScript for the logic, created a function application for users to choose and map their National Parks adventure.  Users input a starting address or location and choose from a state code dropdown to choose parks that are in that state.  Parks are loaded from the National Park Service API that correspond with that state code. Users are then able to choose their preferred parks to visit in that state to add them to their parks selected list.  The user can select multiple parks from multiple states if they would like.  Once their list is compiled and starting location has been input, users can submit their information using the 'Map My Adventure' button that takes them to another page where the list of parks is still displayed and an interactive map from Google's Google Map Platform API shows the most optimized route to visit the parks selected starting and ending at the starting address or location.  Users can remove parks from their list at any time either on the main/initial page or on the page with the map.  Once a park is removed, on the map page, the map will reload with an updated optimized route to visit the parks remaining in the list.  Users are also able to return to the main/initial page at anytime using the back button under the map.  

Ultimately, users are able to create adventures to national parks, either for a day trip or even a cross-country road trip.  Users are able to update their starting address or parks they want to visit at any time, creating an easy to use and dynamic National Park Adventure Planner application.
